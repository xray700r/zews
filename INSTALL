Installing the Software of the ZEWS Weather Station is simple:

1. Download and install the Arduino IDE.

2. Download the code from the GitHub repo.

3. On the Arduino IDE:
Add the Zip libraries downloaded from:
https://github.com/rambo/TinyWire
https://github.com/BoschSensortec/BMP180_driver
https://github.com/adafruit/DHT-sensor-library

BMP180_Breakout_Arduino_Library-master.zip
DHTLib.zip
TinyWireS.zip

4. Also all the files ending in *sensorsuery.cpp *sensorquery.h of the same sensor must be places in a folder with the same name and zipped. 
Include all the Zip libraries on the Arduino IDE.

Example:

AT85sensorquery.zip
BMP180sensorquery.zip
DHTsensorquery.zip
LMsensorquery.zip

5. On the Attiny85's upload the respective code for each sensor. You can use Arduino as ISP and the ISP shield to upload your code.

6. On the Arduino UNO master compile and upload the sketch:
osws_master.ino 

In case all hardware has been set up correctly the output of the serial monitor on the Arduino IDE shall be similar to the following:

REBOOT
BMP180 init success

Weather Sensor Outputs:
Temperature[LM35]= 19.53 *C,
Temperature[DHT11]= 22.00 *C,
Temperature[BMP180]= 21.96 *C,
Humidity[DHT11]= 72.00 %RH,
Pessure[BMP180]absolute= 1002.53 mbar,
Pessure[BMP180]relative= 1014.86 mbar,
Luminance= 0 Lux,
