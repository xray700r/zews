The photos are related to the tests of the ZeWS Weather Station both in Lab and out of Labboratory. 
Main purpose of tests was to gather some real time data and see how the WS reacted to the soft breeze and outside conditions.
It took around 15-20 minutes for the WS sensors to stabilize at the accurate temperature and conditions of humidity of the environment.
